        <h2>About Us</h2>



        <p>Computer Engineering provides the opportunity to work in the continuously changing technology sector. With
          the development of faster hardware components, new communication systems and software there is a demand for
          computer Engineers. Computer Engineering students study the design of digital hardware and software systems.
          Computer Engineering encompasses a wide range of topics including operating systems, computer architecture,
          computer networks, robotics, artificial intelligence and computer-aided design. An important area within
          computer engineering is the development of embedded system devices such as cell phones, digital audio players,
          digital video recorders, alarm systems, x-ray machines and laser surgical tools which require integration of
          hardware and embedded software and these are all the result of computer engineering.</p>

        <p>Software engineering companies, telecommunications firms, designers of digital hardware and many other
          business enterprises hire Computer Engineers right out of college and pay them well.
